    "# Product Sales Analysis Report\n",
    "\n",
    "![](cover1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This report reviews sales for new office products from the first six weeks to see which sales method **(\"Email,\" \"Call,\" or \"Email + Call\")** worked best.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](pic2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset (`product_sales.csv`) initially had 15,000 rows and 8 columns. All columns were validated:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `week`: Values 1-6, as expected. Converted to integer. No other cleaning needed.\n",
    "* `sales_method`: Categories standardized to **\"Email\", \"Call\", \"Email + Call\"**. Converted to factor.\n",
    "* `customer_id`: Character type, as expected. No cleaning needed.\n",
    "* `nb_sold`: Numeric. No negative values. Converted to integer. No other cleaning needed.\n",
    "* `revenue`: Numeric. No negative values. No other cleaning needed.\n",
    "* `years_as_customer`: Numeric. Some values (e.g., up to 63) are higher than the company's age (41 years) and were noted. Converted to integer.\n",
    "* `nb_site_visits`: Numeric. No negative values. Converted to integer. No other cleaning needed.\n",
    "* `state`: Character categories. Converted to factor. No other cleaning needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rows with missing values were removed, leaving 13,926 rows. No duplicate rows were found. The analysis used these 13,926 clean records.\n",
    "\n",
    "--------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploratory Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This section addresses key questions about customer engagement and revenue patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q1: How many customers were there for each approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the reach of each sales method, the number of unique customers was determined:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Email:** Reached **6,922** unique customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Call:** Reached **4,781** unique customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Email + Call:** Reached **2,223** unique customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **\"Email\"** method engaged the largest number of distinct customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![image](image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "--------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2: What does the spread of the revenue look like overall? And for each method?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overall Revenue Spread:** The overall distribution of revenue per transaction was examined. Most sales generate revenue around \\$90, with the middle 50% of sales falling between approximately \\$52 and \\$107.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t![image-4](image-4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spread of Products Sold:** The number of products sold per transaction typically ranges from 8 to 11 items.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t![image-7](image-7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Total Revenue by Method:** The **\"Email\"** method generated the highest overall revenue (\\$672,318) during this period, substantially more than **\"Email + Call\"** (\\$408,257) and **\"Call\"** (\\$227,563).\n",
    "\n",
    "\t![image-8](image-8.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Revenue Spread for Each Method:** When looking at revenue per transaction for each specific sales method:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t- **\"Email + Call\"** typically yielded the highest revenue (around \\$180 median).\n",
    "\n",
    "\t- **\"Email\"** were next (around $100 median).\n",
    "\n",
    "\t- **\"Call\"** had the lowest revenue (around $50 median).\n",
    " \n",
    "\t- The **\"Email + Call\"** method not only has a higher median but also a wider spread towards higher revenue values compared to the other two methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t![image-2](image-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "--------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3: Was there any difference in revenue over time for each of the methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess revenue trends over the 6-week launch period:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **\"Email\"** method consistently generated the highest total weekly revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"Email + Call\"** generally ranked second in weekly revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"Call\"** consistently produced the lowest weekly revenue. While there were weekly fluctuations, no method showed a dramatic sustained increase or decrease over this initial period.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t![image-3](image-3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description of Findings from Exploratory Analysis:**\n",
    "The **\"Email\"** method reached the most customers. In terms of revenue per transaction, **\"Email + Call\"** was the strongest, followed by **\"Email\"** and then **\"Call\"**. This pattern of **\"Email + Call\"** leading in per-transaction value was consistent. Looking at total revenue over time, **\"Email\"** brought in the most money weekly, but the **\"Email + Call\"** method was a solid performer.\n",
    "\n",
    "--------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "To effectively monitor and compare the financial success of different sales strategies, the business should use the **Average Revenue Per Customer (ARPC)**. ARPC is calculated as:  \n",
    "- Total Revenue from a Specific Sales Method / Number of Unique Customers reached by that Method  \n",
    "- By tracking ARPC for each method (e.g., monthly or quarterly)\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the first six weeks of data, the initial ARPC values are:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Email \\+ Call | Email | Call |\n",
    "| ---- | ---- | ---- |\n",
    "| $183.65 | $97.13 | $47.60  |\n",
    "\n",
    "These values show that **\"Email \\+ Call\"** currently generates significantly more revenue per customer than the other methods.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![image-5](image-5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![](arpc.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "--------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Summary Including Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Key Findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **\"Email\"** method had the broadest customer reach (6,922 unique customers) and generated the highest total revenue (\\$672,318). \n",
    "- However, the **\"Email + Call\"** method, despite reaching fewer customers (2,223), was the most efficient in terms of value per customer, achieving an ARPC of \\$183.65. \n",
    "- The **\"Call\"** method reached 4,781 customers but had the lowest ARPC (\\$47.60) and lowest total revenue (\\$227,563).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations for the Business:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prioritize \"Email \\+ Call\" for High-Value Conversions:**\n",
    "   - Given its significantly higher ARPC, this method should be strategically used, especially for customer segments with higher spending potential. The higher revenue per customer appears to justify the combined effort (email \\+ \\~10 min call).  \n",
    "2. **Maintain \"Email\" for Broad Outreach:**\n",
    "   - Continue using the \"Email\" strategy for its wide reach and substantial contribution to overall revenue, especially considering its low resource intensity.  \n",
    "3. **Re-evaluate the Standalone \"Call\" Method:**\n",
    "   - The \"Call\"-only strategy is less effective. It requires more team time (average 30 mins per call) but yields the lowest ARPC. The business should assess if the results justify this time investment or if resources could be better allocated to the more effective methods.  \n",
    "4. **Adopt and Monitor ARPC:**\n",
    "   - Regularly track ARPC for all sales methods as a key performance indicator to guide ongoing strategy and resource allocation.  \n",
    "5. **Address Data Quality:**\n",
    "   - Investigate the years\\_as\\_customer data anomaly (values \\> 41 years) to ensure data accuracy for future, more in-depth customer analyses.  \n",
    "6. **Consider Further Customer Segmentation:**\n",
    "   - Future analysis could explore if customer characteristics (like `nb\\_site\\_visits` or validated `years\\_as\\_customer`) correlate with the success of different sales methods to further refine targeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](conclusion.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "By focusing on methods with higher ARPC and considering the resource implications, the business can optimize its sales approach for new products."
